    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When I was working my way through college at a local diner, I learned that 
        they used leftover baked potatoes from the dinner menu that they baked the
        day before. They always made extra baked potatoes so that they could use
        them for home fries the next morning. I discovered that this was the 'secret'
        to having flaky, crispy home fries. Very easy to make.</p>

    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large baking potatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Scrub the potatoes well and pierce with a fork. Cook on full power in microwave oven
             for 5 minutes; turn the potatoes over and cook 5 more minutes. Remove the potatoes
             from the oven and set aside to cool. Thinly slice the cooled potatoes.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir the butter and onion in a large skillet over medium heat until the onion
             is translucent, about 5 minutes. Gently place the potatoes into the skillet and fry, 
             carefully flipping the potatoes a few times, until slices are browned around the edges. 
             Sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
